What is Cassiopeia?
===================

Cassiopeia (which we fondly call Cass) is a framework for pulling and working with data from the `Riot API <https://developer.riotgames.com/>`_. Cass differentiates itself from other API wrappers by taking a page from one of Cassiopeia's quotes, "I'll take care of everything." Our main goal is to make your life (and ours) as developers *easy*.

Cass is composed of three key pieces:

1) An *interface* for pulling data from the Riot API.

2) A *type system* of classes for holding and working with the data pulled from Riot.

3) *Caches and databases* to temporarily and permanently store that data.

Together, these three pieces provide the user experience we desire. Scroll down for a quick example of how Cass works, what Cass does for you as a user, and information about contributing.


Django web Framework
====================
There is an integration of cassiopeia to the popular python web framework Django made by Mori(Paaksing), this integration is aimed to fix most issues/conflicts that happens when Cassiopeia is paired with a Python web framework (e.g. Django, Flask). In this integration, you will have the ability to use any production tested cache backends that Django's cache framework supports (Memcached, Redis, Filebased, Locmem, Database/SQL, etc), plus others well adapted settings.

* Link to `django-cassiopeia` [repository](https://github.com/paaksing/django-cassiopeia) (If you love using it, make sure to star!).
* Link to `django-cassiopeia` [documentations](https://django-cassiopeia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (A dark theme is added to save you some eyeballs).
* If you have any issues or feature requests with `django-cassiopeia`, tag Mori in our discord server, or fire an issue in the repository.

Unfortunately, we currently don't have an integration to Flask and any contribution is welcome.


Why use Cass?
=============

* An excellent user interface that makes working with data from the Riot API easy and fun.

* "Perfect" rate limiting.

* Guaranteed optimal usage of your API key.

* Built in caching and (coming) the ability to easily hook into a database for offline storage of data.

* Extendability to non-Riot data. Because Cass is a framework and not just an API wrapper, you can integrate your own data sources into your project. Cass already supports Data Dragon and the ``champion.gg`` API in addition to the Riot API.

* Dynamic settings so you can configure Cass for your specific use case.


An Example
==========

We will quickly and efficiently look up the champion masteries for the summoner "Kalturi" (one of the developers) and print the champions he is best at. If you just want a quick look at how the interface looks, feel free to just read these three lines and skip the explanation. The explanation explains how the three bullet points above fit together and allow this code to be run.

.. code-block:: python

    kalturi = Summoner(name="Kalturi")
    good_with = kalturi.champion_masteries.filter(lambda cm: cm.level >= 6)
    print([cm.champion.name for cm in good_with])

    # At the time of writing this, this prints:
    ["Vel'Koz", 'Blitzcrank', 'Braum', 'Lulu', 'Sejuani']

The above three lines are relatively concise code, and if you know what lambdas and list comprehensions are then it will likely be readable. However, there is a deceptive amount of logic in these three lines, so let's break it down. (If you don't understand everything immediately, don't worry, that's why you're using Cass. You don't have to understand how everything works behinds the scenes, you just get to write good code.)

.. code-block:: python

    kalturi = Summoner(name="Kalturi")

First, we create a summoner with a ``name`` and ``id``. Note that creating ``kalturi`` doesn't trigger a call to the Riot API -- it merely instantiates a ``Summoner`` object with a name and id.

.. code-block:: python

    ... = kalturi.champion_masteries ...

Next we ask for the champion  masteries for ``kalturi`` by running ``kalturi.champion_masteries``. This creates an un-instantiated list which will contain champion masteries if any item in it is accessed.

.. code-block:: python

    good_with = kalturi.champion_masteries.filter(lambda cm: cm.level >= 6)

Third, the ``.filter`` method is called on the list of champion masteries. ``filter`` is a python built-in that operates on a list and filters the items in it based on some criteria. That criteria is defined py the ``lambda`` function we pass in.

A lambda is a quick way of defining functions in-line without using the ``def`` statement. In this case, ``lambda cm:`` takes in an object and assigns it to the variable ``cm``, then it returns ``cm.level > 6``. So this ``lambda`` will return ``True`` for any champion mastery whose mastery level is greater than or equal to ``6``.

The ``.filter(lambda cm: cm.level > 6)`` therefore operates on the list of champion masteries. When the list is iterated over, the champion masteries are queried. This requires a summoner id, which is pulled from ``kalturi.id``, and the Riot API is queried for Kalturi's champion masteries. With the champion mastery data pulled, ``.filter`` then filters the list looking for all champion masteries with mastery level 6 or higher.

.. code-block:: python

    print([cm.champion.name for cm in good_with])

Finally, the third line prints a list of the champion names for those champions.

Together these three lines illustrate the concise user interface that Cass provides, the way in which the data can be used, when the data is pulled (queried).
