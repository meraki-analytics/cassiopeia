Using Cassiopeia
================

Objects that hold data from the Riot API can be created using two different interfaces. The top-level ``cassiopeia`` module contains methods to query for objects using method calls, as well as class constructors to create objects directly.

Example usage of the two interfaces:

.. code-block:: python

    import cassiopeia as cass
    kalturi = cass.get_summoner(puuid="...", region="NA")

    from cassiopeia import Summoner
    kalturi = Summoner(puuid="...", region="NA")

Also note that many types can be pulled from ``Summoner`` objects. This is the preferred way to interact with these types. They are listed below:

.. code-block:: python

    from cassiopeia import Summoner
    kalturi = Summoner(puuid="...", region="NA")
    kalturi.champion_masteries
    kalturi.match_history
    kalturi.current_match
    kalturi.leagues
    
Django web Framework
--------------------
There is an integration of cassiopeia to the popular python web framework Django made by Mori(Paaksing), this integration is aimed to fix most issues/conflicts related to co-ocurrence of cassiopeia and Django. In this integration will give you better tools for building your Django/DRF based app, you will have the ability to use any production tested cache backends that Django's cache framework supports.

**New in v2.0:** A new datastore called `Omnistone` is introduced in response to issue #1 of this repo, this is a refined version of `Cache` that automatically deletes expired objects when `MAX_ENTRIES` is hit, then culls the datastore according to the `CULL_FRECUENCY` given. The culling strategy used is the same as Django Cache Framework, which is LRU culling (Least Recently Used).

* Link to `django-cassiopeia` [documentations](https://paaksing.github.io/django-cassiopeia/) (Production Release v2.0).
* If you have any issues or feature requests with `django-cassiopeia`, tag Mori in our discord server, or fire an issue in the repository.

Unfortunately, we currently don't have an integration to Flask and any contribution is welcome.
