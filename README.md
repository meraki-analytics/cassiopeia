# Cassiopeia

A Python adaptation of the Riot Games League of Legends API (https://developer.riotgames.com/).

Cassiopeia is the sister library to [Orianna](https://github.com/robrua/Orianna) (Java). It's been designed with usability in mind - making sure all the bookkeeping is done right so you can focus on getting the data you need and building your application.

## Documentation and Examples
Cassiopeia has detailed [documentation](http://cassiopeia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and [examples](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/cassiopeia/tree/master/examples).


## Installation
`pip install cassiopeia` or see [here](<http://cassiopeia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html>) for more information.


## Why use Cass?

* An excellent user interface that makes working with data from the Riot API easy and fun.

* "Perfect" rate limiting.

* Guaranteed optimal usage of your API key.

* Built in caching and (coming) the ability to easily hook into a database for offline storage of data.

* Extendability to non-Riot data. Because Cass is a framework and not just an API wrapper, you can integrate your own data sources into your project. Cass already supports Data Dragon and the ``champion.gg`` API in addition to the Riot API.

* Dynamic settings so you can configure Cass for your specific use case.


## Example

Here's an example of a basic use of the API. The full documentation can be found at http://cassiopeia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.

```python
import random

import cassiopeia as cass

cass.set_riot_api_key("YOUR_KEY")  # This overrides the value set in your configuration/settings.
cass.set_default_region("NA")

summoner = cass.get_summoner(name="Kalturi")
print("{name} is a level {level} summoner on the {region} server.".format(name=summoner.name,
                                                                          level=summoner.level,
                                                                          region=summoner.region))

champions = cass.get_champions()
random_champion = random.choice(champions)
print("He enjoys playing champions such as {name}.".format(name=random_champion.name))

challenger_league = cass.get_challenger_league(queue=cass.Queue.ranked_solo_fives)
best_na = challenger_league[0].summoner
print("He's not as good as {name} at League, but probably a better python programmer!".format(name=best_na.name))
```
#framework with django
# Django web Framework
There is an integration of cassiopeia to the popular python web framework Django made by Mori(Paaksing), this integration is aimed to fix most issues/conflicts related to co-ocurrence of cassiopeia and Django. In this integration will give you better tools for building your Django/DRF based app, you will have the ability to use any production tested cache backends that Django's cache framework supports.

**_New in v2.0:_** A new datastore called `Omnistone` is introduced in response to issue #1 of this repo, this is a refined version of `Cache` that automatically deletes expired objects when `MAX_ENTRIES` is hit, then culls the datastore according to the `CULL_FRECUENCY` given. The culling strategy used is the same as Django Cache Framework, which is LRU culling (Least Recently Used).

* Link to `django-cassiopeia` [documentations](https://paaksing.github.io/django-cassiopeia/) (Production Release v2.0).
* If you have any issues or feature requests with `django-cassiopeia`, tag Mori in our discord server, or fire an issue in the repository.

Unfortunately, we currently don't have an integration to Flask and any contribution is welcome.
