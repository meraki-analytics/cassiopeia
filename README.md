# Cassiopeia

A Python adaptation of the Riot Games League of Legends API (https://developer.riotgames.com/).

Cassiopeia is the sister library to [Orianna](https://github.com/robrua/Orianna) (Java). It's been designed with usability in mind - making sure all the bookkeeping is done right so you can focus on getting the data you need and building your application.


## Installation
`pip install cassiopeia` or see [here](<http://cassiopeia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html>) for more information.


## Why use Cass?

* An excellent user interface that makes working with data from the Riot API easy and fun.

* "Perfect" rate limiting.

* Guaranteed optimal usage of your API key.

* Built in caching.

* Dynamic settings so you can configure Cass for your specific use case.

* Extendability to non-Riot data. Because Cass is a framework and not just an API wrapper, you can integrate your own data sources into your project. In addition to the Riot API, Cass already supports Data Dragon, Meraki's CDN, and some CDragon data.


## Documentation and Examples
Cassiopeia's [documentation](http://cassiopeia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and [examples](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/cassiopeia/tree/master/examples) may be a little out of date, but should be quite helpful when getting started. Please submit a PR for any changes.


## Example

Here's an example of a basic use of the API. The full documentation can be found at http://cassiopeia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.

```python
import random

import cassiopeia as cass

cass.set_riot_api_key("YOUR_KEY")  # This overrides the value set in your configuration/settings.

region = 'NA'

account = cass.get_account(name="Kalturi", tagline="NA1", region=region)
summoner = account.summoner
print(f"{account.name_with_tagline} is a level {summoner.level} summoner on the {summoner.region} server.")

champions = cass.get_champions(region=region)
random_champion = random.choice(champions)
print(f"He enjoys playing champions such as {random_champion.name}.")

challenger_league = cass.get_challenger_league(queue=cass.Queue.ranked_solo_fives, region=region)
challenger_player = challenger_league[0].summoner
print(f"He's not as good as {challenger_player.account.name} at League, but probably a better python programmer!")
```
